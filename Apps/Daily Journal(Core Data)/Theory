what is Core Data ?
Core Data
Core Data is the method recommended by Apple for local storage of appâ€™s data. By default, core data uses SQLite as its main database in the iOS app.
Internally Core Data make use of SQLite queries to save and store its data locally, which is why all the files are stored as .db files.
This also eliminates the need to install a separate database. In iOS this framework allows for two different database storage types but by default it is SQLite.
Core Data allows you deal with common functionalities of an app like, restore, store, undo and redo.

Core data is a data modelling framework built on the model-view-controller(MVC) pattern. It is expressed in terms of entities and relationships.
We can create entities and add relationships in the graphical form. This helps to eliminate most of the basic code and can be easily added into your application.

Core data provides an API to deal with common functionalities such as Save, Delete, Undo etc. which allows us to build applications easily. 
Using this we need not worry about SQL query and its syntax
